In the French language, Arabic numerals that we use in
everyday can be spelled out just like they can in English. For example, the
numeral 175 is written as one hundred seventy five in English and cent
soixante quinze in French.
French is interesting becuase they have a mixture of a decimal (base
10) and vegesimal (base 20) system, created by committee to placate two
different regions of Franch that used different systems.

Constructed an fst in nltk that can translate any given Arabic numeral
into its corresponding French string. For the sake of convenience, you will
only be given integer input less than 1000.
